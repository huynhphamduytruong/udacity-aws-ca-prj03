# E4T4

## What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Setup Web application firewalls (WAF) to block or log suspicious traffic, or put the web application in a Private subnet.

## Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No, because the default policy of gateway endpoint allows access by any user or service within the VPC to any Amazon S3 resource.

## Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, it only apply to new objects

## What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All resources will go back to original state.
