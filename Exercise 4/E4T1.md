# E4T1

## Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

- Disable SSH password login on the App server
- Restrict network traffic that are allowed to communicate to the App server (by specific IPs, or connections to only allow access to port 5000)

## Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

- Use least privileged access for existing instance to only allow access to specific bucket (Free Recipe in this case)
- Restrict policy to access S3 to only read (according to current use case)
