# E1T4

Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

## Poor practice 1

**:warning: Problem:**

Both public and private subnet network ACL rules allow all traffic on all ports from all ports.

**:bulb: Solution:**

Network ACL rules should be used to minimise the available network connectivity to reduce the traffic that can be sent to and from the subnet. This will reduce the ability for malicious actions that could be performed against the infrastructure by an attacker.

## Poor practice 2

**:warning: Problem:**

Security groups have defined CidrIp set to 0.0.0.0/0. That mean it is possible to communicate from/to any IPs.

**:bulb: Solution:**

Limit CidrIp to necessary services only.
