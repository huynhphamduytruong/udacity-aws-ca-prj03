## Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

- Restrict access to your instance by modifying the Security Groups or ACLs in the network path to specific ports/IPs only.

- Edit the Security Group (sg-0f4fa28dde0e08add) to remove access from the internet on port 21, 23 (in my case)
